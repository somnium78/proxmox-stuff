🚀 Proxmox AMD Optimization Guide
📋 Overview

These optimizations are specifically developed for AMD-based Proxmox systems and improve performance, energy efficiency, and stability. The configurations deliberately deviate from standard settings to achieve maximum performance in controlled environments.
⚡ Kernel Parameter Optimizations
🔧 AMD-specific Parameters

    amd_pstate=active: Activates AMD P-State Driver for better frequency scaling
        Why: Standard ACPI-CPPC is less efficient than native AMD driver
        Benefit: Up to 15% better energy efficiency and more responsive frequency adjustment

    kvm_amd.npt=1: Enables Nested Page Tables for better VM performance
        Why: Drastically reduces memory management overhead in VMs
        Benefit: 10-20% better VM performance for memory-intensive workloads

    kvm_amd.avic=1: Enables Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller
        Why: Hardware-accelerated interrupt processing in VMs
        Benefit: Lower latency and less CPU overhead for I/O operations

⚠️ Performance Parameters (Security-relevant)

    mitigations=off: Disables CPU security mitigations for better performance
        ⚠️ WARNING: Only use in protected, isolated environments!
        Risk: Vulnerability to Spectre/Meltdown-like attacks
        Benefit: 5-15% performance gain depending on workload
        Recommendation: Only in private homelab environments without internet exposure

    nmi_watchdog=0: Disables NMI Watchdog for lower overhead
        Why: Standard watchdog causes continuous CPU interrupts
        Downside: Less debugging info during kernel hangs
        Benefit: Reduces CPU overhead by ~1-2%

🔌 Hardware-specific Parameters

    pcie_aspm=off: Disables PCIe Active State Power Management
        Why: ASPM can cause instability with some NVMe SSDs
        Downside: Slightly higher idle power consumption
        Benefit: Prevents NVMe timeouts and I/O freezes

    nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=0: Disables NVMe Power Saving
        Why: Power states can cause latency spikes
        Trade-off: Higher power consumption vs. consistent performance
        Ideal for: Systems where performance is more important than power saving

🖥️ System-Level Optimizations
🌐 IPv6 Configuration

    Purpose: Completely disable IPv6 as it's usually not needed
    Why deviate: Standard enables IPv6 automatically
    Problems with standard: Unnecessary network complexity, potential security vulnerabilities
    Benefit: Reduces network overhead and attack surface
    Parameter: net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1

💥 Kernel Panic Behavior

    Purpose: System automatically restarts after kernel panic
    Standard: System hangs (panic=0)
    Why change: Unattended systems should self-recover
    Parameter: kernel.panic = 2 (restart after 2 seconds)
    Benefit: Automatic recovery from critical errors
    Downside: Less time for debugging kernel problems

💾 Memory Management
🔄 Swappiness

    Standard: 60 (aggressive swapping)
    Optimized: 10 (minimal swapping)
    Why change: Proxmox VMs need predictable RAM performance
    Problem with standard: VMs get swapped out → performance drops
    Benefit: VMs stay in RAM, consistent performance
    Trade-off: Less available RAM for host processes

✍️ Writeback Optimization

    Standard: 500 centiseconds (5 seconds)
    Optimized: 1500 centiseconds (15 seconds)
    Why change: Frequent small writes harm SSD lifespan
    Benefit: Better write aggregation, longer SSD lifespan
    Downside: Potentially more data loss during power failure
    Mitigation: UPS recommended for critical data

💿 ZFS Optimizations
🧠 ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache)

    ARC Max: 50% of available RAM (instead of 75% standard)
    ARC Min: 12.5% of available RAM (instead of 6.25% standard)
    Why more conservative: VMs need guaranteed RAM access
    Problem with standard: ZFS can "steal" too much RAM
    Benefit: Balanced ratio between ZFS cache and VM memory
    Dynamic: Automatically adapts to available RAM

⚡ ZFS Performance Parameters

    zfs_prefetch_disable=0: Enables prefetching for better read performance
        Standard: Often disabled out of caution
        Why enable: Modern NVMe SSDs benefit from prefetching

    zfs_txg_timeout=5: Optimizes Transaction Group Timeout
        Standard: 5 seconds (already optimal)
        Purpose: Explicitly set for consistency

    zfs_vdev_scheduler=mq-deadline: Uses optimal I/O scheduler
        Standard: Often "none" or "mq-deadline"
        Why explicit: Guarantees optimal scheduler for all devices

🖥️ CPU-specific Optimizations
🔥 AMD 5825U (8 cores) - Balanced Performance

    Governor: powersave (instead of performance)
        Why: Combined with EPP for intelligent scaling
    EPP: balance_power
        Why: Responsive under load, efficient at idle
    Max Frequency: 95% (4.32 GHz instead of 4.55 GHz)
        Reason: 5% performance loss for 10°C less heat
    Target Temperature: ~50°C

🌡️ AMD 5425U (4 cores) - Thermal-focused

    Governor: powersave
    EPP: balance_power
    Max Frequency: 90% (3.6 GHz instead of 4.0 GHz)
        Why more conservative: 4-core design runs hotter than 8-core
    Target Temperature: ~52-55°C
