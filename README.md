# 🚀 Proxmox Management Scripts Collection
## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of scripts, configurations, and documentation for managing and optimizing Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) clusters. Each directory focuses on specific aspects of Proxmox administration, from performance optimization to automation and monitoring.

***Note***: These optimizations are primarily developed for my homelab cluster based on mini-PCs. While many configurations are generally applicable to all Proxmox environments, not everything will suit every setup - always evaluate whether the optimizations match your specific hardware and requirements.

# 🚀 Quick Start
1. 📥 Clone Repository

git clone https://github.com/somnium78/proxmox-stuff.git
cd proxmox-stuff
2. 🔍 Choose Your Focus Area

Navigate to the relevant directory based on your needs:

    Performance issues? → /optimizations
    Need automation? → /automation (coming soon)
    Want monitoring? → /monitoring (coming soon)

3. 📖 Read Documentation

Each directory contains detailed README files with:

    Prerequisites and requirements
    Step-by-step installation guides
    Configuration explanations
    Troubleshooting tips

4. 🧪 Test First

Always test scripts in non-production environments:

    Use VM snapshots before major changes
    Monitor system behavior for 24-48 hours
    Have rollback procedures ready

# ⚠️ Important Warnings
## 🔒 Security Considerations

    Some optimizations trade security for performance
    Review all scripts before execution
    Understand the implications of each change
    Use appropriate security measures for your environment

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

    NEVER run scripts directly in production
    Always backup configurations before changes
    Test in isolated environments first
    Monitor system stability after changes

## 📋 Prerequisites

    Root access to Proxmox nodes
    Basic understanding of Linux system administration
    Familiarity with Proxmox concepts
    Backup and recovery procedures in place
